# Dropbox
Purpose to project, as a part of Assignment 1 for CS5850 Verification & Validation, is to implement a Dropbox style Java application. The application watches a given local folder, and mirrors its contents to a remote cloud storage, in this case AWS S3. 

A side goal is exercise professional coding form, with focus on proper unit testing, code coverage, code style and bug checking of all classes. 

## Installation
Download source project from GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mmedlin1997/cs5850_P1_dropbox
cd cs5850_P1_dropbox
```

## Test
Perform validation tests.
 
`mvn test`

## Run

1 Build the application.
   
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```
   
   Locate the resulting *.jar file: `target/CS5850_P1_Dropbox-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
   
2 Run from the command line.
   
   ```
   cd target
   java -cp CS5850_P1_Dropbox-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  cs5850.CS5850_P1_Dropbox.App
   ```

## Usage
Select a folder on local drive to be used as the drop-box.

Changes to files and folders to the local folder also apply to the S3 folder.
Supported file and folder events are:
 * Add
 * Modify
 * Move
 * Delete 

## Site reporting
This project uses the following Maven plugins for code validation and QA:
* [Cobertura](http://www.mojohaus.org/cobertura-maven-plugin/) for code coverage
* [Checkstyle Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) for coding style
* [Findbugs](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.codehaus.mojo/findbugs-maven-plugin/3.0.5)
for bug checking

To generate report, execute:

```
mvn site
```

Then find reports in:

* `/target/site/cobertura/index.html`
* `/target/site/checkstyle.html`
* `/target/site/findbugs.html`
